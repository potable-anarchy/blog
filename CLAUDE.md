- **Dating Issues:** All dates are valid (no future dates found)

### Template Patterns Identified:
1. **Template A:** "Sometimes the best engineering insights..." (Personal/Experiential) - 10 posts
2. **Template B:** "Building reliable systems..." (SRE/Technical) - 30 posts  
3. **Template C:** "Leadership in technology..." (Leadership/Management) - 25 posts
4. **Template D:** "DevOps is where the rubber meets the road..." (DevOps/Operations) - 20 posts

### Authentic Posts Found:
- `2024-in-sound.html` - Genuine music/engineering reflection
- `building-resilient-systems.html` - Authentic SRE content
- `remote-team-building-lessons-from-virtual-collaboration.html` - Real remote work insights

### Content Replacement Progress:
**âœ… REPLACED WITH AUTHENTIC CONTENT:**
